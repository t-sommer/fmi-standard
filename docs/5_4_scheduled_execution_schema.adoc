=== Description Schema [[scheduled-execution-schema]]

The common XML elements and attributes are defined in <<fmi-description-schema>>.
Additional elements and attributes are defined subsequently.
If the FMU implements the Scheduled Execution interface type, the element `<ScheduledExecution>` must be present.
It is defined as:

.ScheduledExecution element.

==== Example XML Description File

The simulation algorithm collects the information about the number and properties of <<Clock,`Clocks`>> supported by the FMU via analyzing the <<modelDescription.xml>> as defined in <<fmi-description-schema>>.
For every <<inputClock>> the simulation algorithm defines a task.
The properties `period` and `priority` are defined based on the <<inputClock,`input clocks'`>> `period` and `priority` defined in the <<modelDescription.xml>>.
The simulation algorithm can read from the <<modelDescription.xml>> that <<outputClock>> OutClock may tick triggered by <<inputClock>> 10msClock and that <<inputClock>> AperiodicClock is triggered by OutClock.
